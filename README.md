# Iter Tools
This is a package that provides Collection utilities, similar to the ones found in Symphony, Laravel, or
the PHP standard library.

It is all coded against the `iterable` interface, so you can use this package with any kind of "list" data.

You no longer have to check if what you have is an array, or a Collection, or a whatever-the-heck.
